mystery_word_hard.py is definitely the more refined version of the game.

mystery_word_normal.py is the Normal Mode of the homework assignment. This is
a simple game in which the player picks one letter at a time, trying to figure out
what word the computer has chosen. The computer's word choice is represented
by an underscore for each letter, and is replaced with correct letter choices
as they are made. With only 8 misses allowed and a crazy list of words the
computer can choose from, the player stands no chance of winning this game.

(perhaps I should revisit the normal version to pull more of it into functions.)

mystery_word_hard.py is the Hard Mode of the assignment. This version of the
game allows the player to pick the difficulty level, verifies the player's input,
and then gives the player a choice of playing again. The player stands a better
chance of winning this game, though even Easy Mode is still pretty tough to win.
